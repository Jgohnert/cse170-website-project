            <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>First Speaker: Gary E. Stevenson and Sister Stevenson</p>
                  <p>What we learned: Sister Stevenson shared how when she find out that our Heavenly Father was there for her. She understood that she was there for her (and all of us) to understand us, love us, and to answer our prayer. She tought us taht once we have thos things present on our nmminds we will be able to put faith over fear.</p> 
                  <p>Elder Stevenson, gave several invitations during his talk, inviting us to be in good places and attend the temple regularly; He also invites us to introduce ourselves to our bishops, and trust that they are here to help, not to judge; He invite us, and taught us how to have a gospel perspective, and find a spiritual balance no matter how busy or occupied our lives can be. He blessed us so these teachings can work as a North Star in our life, and promised that as we do these things, we wil experience happiness and joy.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Second Speaker: Jason Floraâ€™s</p> 
                    <p>What we learned: We really liked how he said we can measure our success based on our faithfulness and also, how can no one do the job we are doing here on earth, but us; that's really special since it gives you a sense of purpose and belonging.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Third Speaker: Philip Crane</p> 
                    <p>What we learned: He taught us how to do the small an simple things to be able to put on the full armour of God.</p>
                </li>
            <section>
                <h2>What we learned</h2>
                <p>We learned that it is easier to remember what we are learning when we discuss it as a team.</p>
                <p>We also learned that we can better understand different perspectives of the devotionals messages when we listen to each other and our take-aways from what we heard.</p>

                <li>Influence:   Self, Consciousness, Conduct. </li>
                <li>BYU-Idaho ILO Mission:</li>
                <li>Values:We believe that as we diligently attend the devotionals, we will be able to grow spiritually as a group, which in turn will keep us on the right track as we perform our tasks according to the values of being a disciple of Christ.</li>
                <li>Vision:We intend to gain experience with keeping to a regular schedule so that we'll be disciplined in sticking to the one-hour meeting time we establish for ourselves each week. We are confident that we will be able to meet this objective if we work hard every Tuesday to prepare for the spiritual lessons that will only serve to lead us in the weeks to come.</li>
                <li>SMART Goal:</li>
                <li>Specific: We will be attending the Tuesday devotionals as a team for the rest of the semester. It is important to stay engaged as a team by committing  the time that we set for ourselves to attend.	</li>
                <li>Measurable: We will be able to measure our time weekly as we attend the devotional every week. 	</li>
                <li>Attainable: We can accomplish this because we will be keeping our schedules open during the time that we need to attend. 	</li>
                <li>Relevant: We will be able to grow spiritually together and grow as a team as we keep ourselves on this timely schedule. We will make sure that we attend every week, and we will also feel more engaged as a group as we work to meet each other every Tuesday.	</li>
                <li>Timely: We will be setting aside 1 hour every week in order to attend the devotional. </li>
                <li>Milestones:
                    <p>1. Go together for the first time to devotional</p>
                    <p>2. Go together for 3 weeks.</p>
                    <p>3. Go together for  5 weeks/Quiz each other on what we learned so far.</p>
                    <p>4. Go together and invite one friend.</p>
                    <p>5. Go by ourselves with other friends.</p>
