                <p>We had this great idea to make our presentation into a website, since all of us are taking a web fundamentals class and learning how to do web pages. We were able to share skills, and mentor each other in the process of creating this web page.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            <p>We learned that our different inputs and ideas for a project like building a website makes it easier for us as a team to make something even better than what one person can come up with on their own.</p>
            <p>We also learned new skills when programming together, and that we were able to teach each other along the way.</p>
