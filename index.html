               <p>In a world where Dolores, a half-elf wizard, Jacob, a fairy paladin knight, and Joanna, a noble halfling wizard paths to put themself on the greatest adventure they will ever experience.</p>
                <p> One day while they were chilling at the infamous Spoons Hotel, a loud horn was sounded by an army of draconic warriors led by their leader Thoth. 
                    The army attacks the village and were defeated by Dolores, Jacob, and Joanna, who have managed to capture one of the draconic warriors for questioning using their amazing teamwork skills. 
                    The captured draconic warrior reveals the attack on the village was a distraction so that they could free a powerful blue dragon. 
                    The party was then offered a great sum of gold to find and kill this dragon so that the village will be safe once more. 
                    Using the Money that Jacob persuaded for us to recieve, Joanna bought the magnificent wand of wonder before the three set off to slay the dragon. 
                    Dolores acted as bait while Joanna and Jacob infultrated the ruins up on a mountain where the dragon resided. 
                    Once they came face to face with the blue dragon after much stealth and persuasion, they fought. 
                    Dolores was unfortunately hit unconceous by the dragon's immense power, and Jacob and Joanna were barely keeping themselves alive.
                    Desperate, Joanna used the wand of wonder and rolled a 75, which casted fireball, obliterating the dragon and saving the village.</p>
               <p>We had 3 weekeds of pure fun while playing D&D. We defeated mythical creatures, learned new magic spells and implamented teamwork to get our tasks done.</p>
               <p> and we had fun getting to now each other and speny time together along with Joanna's brother Matt, who is super cool!! And an awesome DM! </p>

                <h2>What We learned</h2>
                <p>We learned that working to defeat a blue dragon is possible at our low levels when we work together as a team to make every possible attack and distraction count.</p>
                <p>We also learned that we work more effectively when we discuss and come to an agreement on all of our decisions.</p>

                <li>Values: We hope that by playing D&D, we will be able to foster friendship and collaboration via teamwork while critically thinking our way through our journey to success.</li>
                <li>Vision: Our vision for success is to take advantage of the time we meet online to play a session and to climb over any obstacle that comes our way. We will all share the same goal in order to complete the campaign, which is why we will be able to succeed in this task.</li>
                <li>SMART Goal:</li>

                <li>Measurable: We will be playing twice a week for 2 hours. Our goal is complete once we beat the campaign.	</li>
                <li>Attainable: Due to our busy schedules, we will be meeting over zoom at the same time twice a week, which will be convenient for us to stay on track until we beat the campaign.	</li>
                <li>Relevant: It is relevant because we want to get to know each other in a fun and engaging way that will help us understand ourselves and each other, which in turn will benefit our teamwork for our other projects.	</li>
                <li>Timely: Because of how flexible we can be over zoom, we can easily manage our time while playing D&D. My brother will be the DM, guiding us through the story in a way that gets us to our goal in a timely manner. We also intend to stay true to the plot and concentrate on the task at hand in order to achieve maximum success.	</li>
