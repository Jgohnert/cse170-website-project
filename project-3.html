                <p>We had so much fun sharing our skills with others while doing service. Cleaning our friends apartment and ushering for Devotional were very self-rewarding experiences. People were really nice to us and complemented us for what we were doing. As college students, it's really hard to find time on our busy schedule to do service, but this little project gave us a taste of it again, and even though it is something out of our comfort zone, we might find more of these opportunities in the near future.</p>

            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            <p>We learned that when we devide the work as a team, we can get the job done much faster than if we were to do it ourselves.</p>
            <p>We also learned that we can better manage our job when working together, because we understand that we as a team want to succeed, and by having this mindset, we are able to stay motivated in the work.</p>

        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>Name: Presentation Website </li>
            <li>Influence: Group, Connectedness, Cooperation</li>
            <li>BYU-Idaho ILO Mission:</li>
            <li>Values:We'll be collaborating on the presentations of our four projects. It will serve to keep us motivated while also inspiring us to strive for the completion of our work and establish comradery. We hope to learn more skills when it comes to web design, and as a way to study wdd130 together in order to help each other work through the class and this project as a team.</li>
            <li>Vision:We will be polishing our html/css skills by coding this entire website ourselves. it may not be perfect, but we will strive for the best outcome and go beyond our capabilities as an opportunity to improve on our skills.</li>
            <li>SMART Goal:</li>
            <li>Specific:  Create a website presentation of our projects and keep track of our progress every week by doing so.</li>
            <li>Measurable: We will be meeting for an hour or two each week to work on this code.</li>
            <li>Attainable: We will use this time to practice and polish our weak spots in html. It is something we can attain because we are capable of learning more about this skill.</li>
            <li>Relevant: It will help us become better at coding and actually do some team work on coding ;)
                We are all new to coding, which is why we wanted to do this project in order to better ourselves.</li>
            <li>Timely: We will be able to keep track of our time through Zoom and make sure everyone meets during a time when we are free and able to work on it together.</li>
            <li>Milestones:
                <p>1. Go and look for activities we can sign up for the future + do a service</p>
                <p>2.  Go and Serve for an hour</p>
                <p>3.  Go to a plan service</p>
                <p>4.  Go and serve for an hour</p>
                <p>5.  Bring people to come serve with us for an hour</p>
