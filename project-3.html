                <p>We had so much fun sharing our skills with others while doing service. Cleaning our friends apartment and ushering for Devotional were very self-rewarding experiences. People were really nice to us and complemented us for what we were doing. As college students, it's really hard to find time on our busy schedule to do service, but this little project gave us a taste of it again, and even though it is something out of our comfort zone, we might find more of these opportunities in the near future.</p>

            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            <p>We learned that when we devide the work as a team, we can get the job done much faster than if we were to do it ourselves.</p>
            <p>We also learned that we can better manage our job when working together, because we understand that we as a team want to succeed, and by having this mindset, we are able to stay motivated in the work.</p>
